I use difference/differential equation modeling, agent-based modeling, matrix projection models, and more. Here are some highlights of my work:\n\nManaging the sylvatic plague in black-tailed prairie dogs\nDe-extinction strategies for the passenger pigeon\nVaccination strategies for white-nose syndrome in little brown bats\nModeling sublethal stressors on bee colonies\nHunting strategies to suppress the winter tick epizootic in moose\nModeling pollen competition and interference in plants\n\nMy complete works can be found on my Google Scholar Profile\nI enjoy working with interdisciplinary teams, and with colleagues across the world. If you‚Äôre interested in working together, please reach out to me!\nI‚Äôve worked with several student researchers, from REUs, programs internal to UWL, federal scholar programs, etc. If you are interested in undergraduate research, please reach out to me!"

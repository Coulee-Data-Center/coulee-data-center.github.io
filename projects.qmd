This work is wrapping up! We are excited to have worked with [Habitat for Humanity of the Greater La Crosse Region](https://www.habitatlacrosse.org/) ("habitat") on our inaugural project!

We are producing a historical review of the impact habitat has had on our communities. We're synthesizing information on property taxes, home values, construction costs, and more!

Habitat will be able to use our report as a clear, objective, data-based measurement of their impact, hopefully aiding in their ability to secure competitive grants, reduce costs, and amplify their impact. 

Pictured is our team presenting initial findings with Kahya Fox, the Executive Director of Habitat for Humanity. The final report can be found [here](https://github.com/Coulee-Data-Center/coulee-data-center.github.io/blob/main/_reports/habitat.pdf).
